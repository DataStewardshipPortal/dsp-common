# Data Stewardship Wizard Common Repository

This repository is mainly used for reporting bugs from users and gathering ideas which may be nice to implement. Feel free to report bugs or suggest ideas.

## Processing

We will respond you ASAP on your reported bug and suggested an idea. 

Issues / bugs / ideas which are selected for realization are then captured in Jira (http://ds-wizard.atlassian.net). So every issue / bug idea is transformed into Jira by us. Of course, we will leave it a link here so you can see the progress of it.
